# Turtle Crossing Game

The Turtle Crossing Game is a simple yet engaging Python game where players guide a turtle across a busy road. Developed using the Python Turtle Graphics library, this game challenges players to navigate through moving traffic without getting hit by cars. As the player progresses, the difficulty increases, providing an entertaining way for players to improve their reaction times and decision-making skills.

## Features

- **Dynamic Traffic**: Cars of various colors move across the screen, creating obstacles for the player.
- **Level Progression**: The game becomes progressively more challenging as the player advances in levels.
- **Simple Controls**: Use the keyboard to move the turtle up, down, left, or right.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the current level as the player's score, updating with each successful crossing.

## Prerequisites

To run this game, you'll need:

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.
- The Python Turtle Graphics library (comes pre-installed with Python).

## Setup

To get started with the Turtle Crossing Game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. There's no need to install additional packages, as the game uses the built-in Turtle Graphics library.

## Running the Game

Navigate to the directory containing the game files in your terminal or command prompt. Run the game using Python:
